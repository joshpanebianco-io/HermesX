/**
 * A sparkline — the session's shape in 60 pixels.
 *
 * WHY IT EARNS THE SPACE ON A DENSE BOARD. A percentage change says where a
 * price ended up relative to yesterday and nothing about how it got there. Up
 * 0.4% having fallen all morning and reversed is a different market from up
 * 0.4% in a straight line at the open, and on a board of forty instruments
 * that difference is the whole reason to look at more than one of them.
 *
 * NO AXES, NO LABELS, NO TOOLTIP. It is a glyph, not a chart — the figures
 * beside it carry every number a reader needs, and axis furniture at this size
 * would cost more pixels than the line.
 *
 * THE BASELINE IS THE PRIOR CLOSE, not the series minimum. Drawn against its
 * own low, every sparkline starts at the bottom-left and looks like a rally;
 * against the prior close, a line that spends the session under water sits
 * visibly under the rule, which is the thing worth seeing at a glance.
