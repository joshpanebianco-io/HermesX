/**
 * A module — the terminal's one container.
 *
 * WHY NOT A CARD. A card floats on a page grid with a gap and a shadow; a
 * terminal is one chassis divided into panes. The module keeps a card's
 * anatomy (title, subtitle, right slot, body) because the information
 * hierarchy is the same, and drops the floating chrome because the claim is
 * different. The header's mono/uppercase/tracked typography IS the terminal
 * character — the vibrancy layer here is luminance, never texture.
 *
 * EVERY MODULE STATES ITS OWN AGE. `ageMin` prints in the header as a chip,
 * and it turns amber past ten minutes and red past sixty. Panels on this
 * screen run on clocks that are half an hour apart — the wire at two minutes,
 * the curve at thirty — and one shared "as of" in the corner of the page would
 * be a lie about five of the six.
