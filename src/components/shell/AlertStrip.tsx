/**
 * The alert line — high-impact headlines, crawling, on every tab.
 *
 * A CRAWL, MATCHING GEXYGEN (owner instruction, 2026-08-31). The first cut was
 * a fixed row that scrolled by hand, on the argument that a moving target
 * cannot be scanned. That argument is right about the WIRE COLUMN and wrong
 * here: this strip is one line tall, it holds sixteen items on a day like
 * today, and a fixed row shows three of them and hides the rest behind a
 * scrollbar nobody drags. A crawl shows all sixteen without being asked, which
 * is the entire job of an alert line.
 *
 * IT PAUSES UNDER THE POINTER, so a line can be read or clicked, and under
 * reduced motion it does not move at all and becomes the hand-scrolled row
 * instead.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM IS GEXYGEN'S. Two copies of the run back to back, translated by
 * exactly half the width so the seam is invisible, with the duration computed
 * from the measured width rather than fixed — that is what keeps a long tape
 * and a short one crawling at the same READING PACE instead of the same
 * duration.
 *
 * IT DISAPPEARS WHEN THERE IS NOTHING. An always-present bar reading "no
 * alerts" trains you to ignore exactly the space that has to catch your eye
 * when something does land.
