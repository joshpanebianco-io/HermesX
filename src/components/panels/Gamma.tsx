/**
 * Gamma levels, borrowed from GEXYGEN.
 *
 * SEVEN NUMBERS PER ASSET AND NOT ONE MORE — three call walls, three put
 * walls, the gamma flip. GEXYGEN is where a gamma map is read, with its strike
 * profile and its greeks; what belongs on a news terminal is the handful of
 * prices that say where dealer hedging turns, so a headline can be judged
 * against them.
 *
 * DRAWN AS A LADDER, IN PRICE ORDER, WITH SPOT IN IT. A table sorted by
 * "call wall, call wall 2, call wall 3, put wall…" is the file's order, not
 * the market's — and on a real chart the third call wall can sit BELOW the
 * first put wall, which a grouped table hides completely. Price order with
 * spot's own row in the stack is the only arrangement where "where are we"
 * and "what is above us" are answered by looking rather than by arithmetic.
 *
 * THE COLOURS ARE GEXYGEN'S, byte-identical, so a wall is the same teal here,
 * there, on the TradingView indicator and in NinjaTrader.
 *
 * RANK IS CHEVRONS, NOT A TRAILING DIGIT — the same ordinal GEXYGEN's Major
 * Walls card draws. "Call wall 2" and "Call wall 3" put the WEAKEST claim in
 * the most prominent position: the ladder is sorted by price, so the numbers
 * ran 2, 3, 1 down the column and the heaviest wall on the side was the one
 * with no number at all. Three chevrons is the heaviest, one is the third, and
 * because it is a mark rather than a digit it reads at a glance without being
 * compared to its neighbours.
