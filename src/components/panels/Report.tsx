 * view rather than narrate a deterministic one (see server/newsterminal/
 * report.py). That makes the provenance strip below load-bearing rather than
 * decorative: the model name, the moment, and a link to the exact digest it was
 * shown are the only way to tell a good call from a lucky one later. Nothing
 * here is generated locally — with no key the panel says so and shows nothing,
 * because a fabricated bias rendered in the same frame as a real one is the
 * worst thing this product could do.
 *
 * THE BIAS BAR IS A POSITION, NOT A GAUGE. Five states from bearish to bullish
 * with a mark on a track, because "leaning bearish" is a point on a line and a
 * coloured pill would lose the distance between it and "bearish".
