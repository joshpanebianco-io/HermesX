/**
 * The Fed's own diary — who speaks, and when, before they speak.
 *
 * THE WIRE ALREADY CARRIES FED SPEECHES. It carries them afterwards. On this
 * desk's own tape, "Barclays sees two more Fed rate hikes after Warsh speech"
 * and "Warsh's Jackson Hole comments" were both moving the market and the
 * terminal had no way to know either was coming. This panel is the forward
 * half of the same information, straight from the Board's events feed.
 *
 * FORWARD ONLY. A Fed speech that has already happened is a headline, and the
 * wire is where headlines live — repeating it here as a diary entry would be
 * the same fact twice in two voices.
 *
 * THE FOMC IS NOT A SPEECH AND IS NOT DRAWN LIKE ONE. A decision and a press
 * conference stop the tape; a governor at a research conference does not. The
 * amber rail is for the ones that reprice the front of the curve.
 *
 * TREASURY SUPPLY LIVES IN THE SAME DIARY, because it is the same question —
 * scheduled US rates risk — asked of the other end of the curve. The Fed rows
 * reprice the front; a tailed 10s or 30s auction repricing the long end at
 * 13:01 ET is an equity event for the longest-duration index on the board.
 * One panel, one chronology, rather than two lists the reader has to merge in
 * their head.
