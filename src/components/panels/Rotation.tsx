/**
 * Sector rotation — who is being bought, measured against the index.
 *
 * RELATIVE STRENGTH, NOT RETURN. On a day the whole market is up 1%, a sector
 * up 0.8% is being SOLD relative to it, and an absolute-return table shows
 * that as green. Every bar here is excess return over SPY, which is the only
 * form of the number that answers "is money rotating in".
 *
 * THE SPAN IS A REAL TENSION, and the default sits on the near side of it.
 * Rotation is properly a claim about weeks — one session's move is noise
 * against it, and a leadership table built on a single day reshuffles every
 * morning. But this terminal is read at the open to judge the day ahead, and
 * for that question the month is answering something else. So it opens on 1D
 * with 1W and 1M one click away; see the note on SPANS.
 *
 * SPY AND RSP ARE ON THE LIST BUT NOT IN THE RANKING. SPY is the benchmark and
 * would always read exactly zero; RSP against SPY is the breadth trade — equal
 * weight beating cap weight means the rally is broadening — which is a
 * different claim from a sector's and is stated separately underneath.
 */

/*
 * 1D FIRST AND 1D BY DEFAULT (owner instruction, 2026-08-31).
 *
 * The panel opened on a month because rotation is a claim about weeks and one
 * session is noise against it — that argument still holds and is why 1W and 1M
 * are one click away. But this terminal is read at the open to judge the day
 * ahead, and for that question the honest span is the one the session is
 * actually trading. The button order follows the default: the first chip is
 * the one you land on.
