/**
 * A piece of UI state that survives a reload.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS WHAT RENDERS FIRST, ALWAYS. localStorage does not exist on the
 * server, so reading it during render would make the first client render
 * disagree with the server's markup and React would throw the tree away — the
 * same hydration trap the clock and the relative timestamps hit. So the hook
 * starts on the default, reads storage once after mount, and only then applies
 * the stored value. A saved filter therefore appears a frame late, which is
 * invisible and correct, rather than never or broken.
 *
 * ONLY PREFERENCES BELONG HERE. Nothing derived from market data is stored:
 * a remembered filter is a preference and stays true, a remembered price is a
 * lie the moment it is written.
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed on purpose. Storage throws in private windows and
 * when a browser is set to block site data, and a terminal that will not render
 * because it could not remember which tab you were on is worse than one that
 * forgets.
