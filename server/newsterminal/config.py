Configuration — every value has a working default.

NOTHING HERE IS REQUIRED. The terminal runs with an empty environment; the
optional keys only widen coverage, and every panel that depends on one says so
on its own face rather than rendering an empty box. That is the same contract
GEXYGEN's `.env.example` makes, and it exists for the same reason: a terminal
that silently shows nothing is indistinguishable from a terminal that is
telling you nothing is happening.

# you would have two call walls on two screens and no way to know which is
