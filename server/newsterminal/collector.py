"""
The collector — one background thread, many clocks.

WHY A THREAD AND NOT A REQUEST HANDLER. If the panels fetched on demand, the
first load after a cold start would sit for thirty seconds while forty
upstreams answered one at a time, and every reader who opened a second tab
would pay it again. The collector keeps a warm snapshot and the API hands out
whatever it currently holds; a page load costs one in-memory read.

WHY ONE THREAD AND NOT A POOL. The cadences are seconds to half-hours apart, so
at any given tick there is usually one source due, occasionally two. A pool
would buy nothing and would mean the tick log — the thing this window exists to
show — could interleave two half-written rows.

EVERY SOURCE IS INDEPENDENT. A source that raises is caught, logged on its own
row, and leaves the previous good data in place with its age climbing. That is
why `age_min` is on every block: a panel showing eleven-minute-old sector data
is fine as long as it says eleven minutes.
