The wire — every desk's headlines on one tape.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE FROM GEXYGEN. That project ships commercially, so its
wire is confined to US Government works and openly-licensed feeds: titles and
links only, no summary, and the big agencies excluded outright. This terminal
runs on one desk for one reader, which is the use every publisher's RSS terms
actually contemplate — so the wires come back, the summary line comes with
them, and Reuters and AP are recovered through Google News' index because
neither serves a usable public feed of its own any more.

The rules that keep that honest are still here, because they are good practice
rather than a licence condition: every item names its publisher on the line,
every item links back to the publisher's own page, and nothing is cached
beyond the poll interval.

CATEGORY IS ASSIGNED TWICE. Once from the feed it arrived on — a Bloomberg
Economics item is macro by construction — and then again from the headline
text, which can promote it. A strike on a refinery arriving on the world feed
is energy news; the feed cannot know that and the words can.
