"""
The economic calendar — what prints, when, and what the street expects.

WHY THE CONSENSUS MATTERS MORE THAN THE PRINT. A number is not bullish or
bearish on its own; it is bullish or bearish against what was already in the
price. So every row here carries actual, consensus and previous together, and
a `surprise` computed from the first two — because the reaction is a function
of the gap, and reading it off three separate columns during the two seconds
after 08:30 is not a thing anyone does well.

RANKED, NOT FILTERED. A calendar that shows everything is a wall of Korean
industrial production; a calendar that shows only the US misses the BoJ
decision that moves the yen that moves the Nasdaq. Every row is kept and
scored, and the UI shows the top of the list by default.
