"""
The Fed's own calendar — who speaks, and when, before they speak.

THE GAP THIS FILLS. The wire already carries Federal Reserve speeches, but it
carries them as RSS — which means it tells you what was said after it was said.
On this desk's own tape, "Barclays sees two more Fed rate hikes after Warsh
speech" and "Warsh's Jackson Hole comments" were both moving the market, and the
terminal had no way to know either was coming. An unscheduled remark cannot be
prepared for; a scheduled one can, and the Board publishes the schedule.

THE SOURCE IS THE BOARD'S OWN EVENTS FEED. `calendar.json` behind
federalreserve.gov, a US Government work, carrying about 2,600 entries from 2017
out to the end of the current year, each with a type, a date, a time and a title
naming the speaker.

STATISTICAL RELEASES ARE DROPPED. Roughly 40% of the file is `Stat` — H.10
foreign exchange rates, H.15 selected interest rates, the commercial paper
series. They are data publications on a fixed schedule, not events anyone
positions around, and they would bury the fourteen entries a quarter that
actually matter. What is kept is the FOMC, speeches, testimony and the Beige
Book.

DATES COME APART AND ARE PUT BACK TOGETHER. `month` is "2026-09" and `days` is a
string that may be "3" or "3,4" for a two-day meeting — so a single entry can be
several dates, and the first day is the one to schedule against.
