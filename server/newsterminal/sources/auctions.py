Treasury supply — the auctions that move the long end, before they happen.

WHY A NEWS TERMINAL CARES. A weak 10-year or 30-year auction reprices the whole
curve at 13:01 ET, and the Nasdaq — the longest-duration equity index on the
board — moves with it. The economic calendar upstream does not carry auctions,
so without this the terminal knew every CPI print for a fortnight ahead and
nothing about the $40bn of duration landing on Wednesday.

THE SOURCE IS TREASURYDIRECT'S OWN FEED — `TA_WS/securities/upcoming`, a US
Government work, no key, about a fortnight of forward visibility.

BILLS ARE DROPPED. Most of the file is weekly bill rollover — 4-week through
52-week paper that clears mechanically and moves nothing. What is kept is
coupon supply: Notes, Bonds and TIPS, the auctions a rates desk actually
watches. FRNs and cash-management bills go with the bills.

REOPENINGS ARE NAMED BY WHAT THEY ARE. The feed calls a 10-year reopening a
"9-Year 11-Month", which is true and useless; `originalSecurityTerm` carries
the name the market uses, and the row keeps a `reopening` flag because a
reopening usually clears more easily than new paper.

ONE CONVENTION: coupon auctions close at 13:00 ET. The feed gives no time, and
that has been the standard competitive close for years; it is a display hint,
not data.
