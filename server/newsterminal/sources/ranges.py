Session ranges — where each desk traded, not just where the day traded.

WHY THIS IS THE BIGGEST GAP A PRE-OPEN NOTE HAD. A day high and low says the
range was 240 points and nothing about who set it. "London already took out the
Asia high and failed" and "Asia set the high at 20:00 and we have bled since"
are the same two numbers and opposite sessions. The owner trades Asia and
London as well as New York, so the question is not only "what happened
overnight" — it is "what happened in the session I am about to trade, and in
the one that just handed over to it".

FIVE WINDOWS, IN ET, AND THEY DO NOT OVERLAP.

  asia      18:00 → 02:00   Globex reopens; Tokyo and Hong Kong lead
  london    02:00 → 05:00   the London OPEN window, where Europe does its damage
  euro_mid  05:00 → 08:00   European midday; US premarket starts building
  preny     08:00 → 09:30   the overlap and the 08:30 data window
  ny        09:30 → 16:00   US cash

The boundaries are the handovers a trader actually uses, not the exchanges'
own hours — London cash runs to 11:30 ET but by 09:30 the flow is American, and
a "London range" that included the US open would describe neither.

LONDON IS THE OPEN WINDOW, 02:00-05:00, AND IT STARTS BEFORE THE CASH BELL.
The LSE opens at 08:00 London, which is 03:00 ET all year (the two
hemispheres shift together for this pair).
But European flow is already in by then: Eurex futures open at 08:00 CET —
02:00 ET — and the London desks are at their screens an hour before the cash
open. The hour from 02:00 is European-driven, and counting it as Asia described
it as thin Globex drift when it is nothing of the kind. `resolve_session` in
report.py has always used 02:00 for the same reason; the windows here now agree
with it instead of contradicting it by an hour.

IT ENDS AT 05:00 BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS DONE. "London took out the
Asia high" is a claim about the OPEN move; run the window to 08:00 and it
absorbs three hours of midday drift and stops meaning that. So the leftovers get
their own window rather than diluting this one — euro_mid exists to be somewhere
else for them to go. Note the report still writes a LONDON SESSION note across
roughly 02:00-07:30 (resolve_session); this row is labelled "London open" so two
different spans are never both called London.

EVERYTHING IN ET, converted from the bar's own epoch. The instruments settle on
CME's clock, which is New York's; deriving from local time would put every
boundary an hour out for the weeks the two hemispheres' DST disagree.
