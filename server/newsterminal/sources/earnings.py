Earnings — the reports that move an index rather than a stock.

WHY A NEWS TERMINAL FOR INDEX FUTURES CARRIES EARNINGS AT ALL. The Nasdaq 100
is a cap-weighted index in which roughly the top seven names are a third of it.
NVDA after the close moves NQ harder than most macro prints move it in a week,
and a session note written without knowing who reports tonight is missing the
single largest scheduled risk in it. That is a different claim from "track every
earnings release": a small-cap beat is noise to this desk.

FILTERED BY MARKET CAP, NOT BY INDEX MEMBERSHIP. Membership lists go stale and
would need maintaining; capitalisation is in the payload, it is the thing that
actually determines index impact, and it needs no second source. Everything
above the threshold is kept and everything below is dropped, so the panel is
five or ten names a day rather than three hundred.

BEFORE OR AFTER THE BELL IS THE FIELD THAT MATTERS. An after-hours report is
tomorrow's gap; a pre-market one is this morning's. Nasdaq gives it and it rides
on every row.
