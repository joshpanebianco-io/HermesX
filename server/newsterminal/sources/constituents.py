"""
What the heavy names are doing — the two or three stocks that ARE the move.

THE ARGUMENT, WHICH IS GEXYGEN'S AND IS RIGHT. NQ is a cap-weighted basket in
which the top nine names are about 43% of it: NVDA 8.4%, AAPL 7.5%, MSFT 6.1%,
MU 4.6%, AMZN 4.6%. On most days two or three of them supply most of the index
move. So the useful ranking is not percent change, it is CONTRIBUTION — weight
times return — because a 6% move in a 0.3% weight is noise and a 2% move in an
8% weight is the tape. That distinction is the whole reason this panel exists
rather than a list of biggest movers.

WEIGHTS FROM THE ISSUER, RETURNS FROM THE TAPE. iShares publishes the full
holdings of its NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500 UCITS trackers as CSV — both are
full-replication funds, so their baskets ARE the indices, and the file is the
fund's own disclosure rather than the index provider's IP. Returns come from
the same batched Yahoo endpoint the board uses.

ONE PARSER FOR BOTH, and that is why iShares is used for the S&P rather than
SSGA's own SPY file: SSGA publishes .xlsx, which is a zip of XML and a parser
this service does not otherwise need. Two indices in one CSV shape is worth
more than sourcing each from its own issuer.

GERMAN LOCALE. The files come from iShares' German site — "8,37" is eight point
three seven and "2.506.028.501,10" is two and a half billion. Parsed
explicitly, because `float("8,37")` raises and `float("2.506")` silently
returns 2.506.
