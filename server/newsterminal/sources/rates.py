"""
Rates — the curve, the policy rate, and what the market thinks happens next.

THREE SOURCES, THREE CLOCKS, DELIBERATELY NOT MERGED.

  Treasury    the par yield and real yield curves. A daily print, published
              late afternoon ET, US Government work.
  NY Fed      EFFR and SOFR — where policy ACTUALLY is today, published
              at 08:00 ET for the prior business day.
  CME (Yahoo) the 30-day fed funds futures strip — where the market thinks
              policy GOES. This is the same instrument CME's own FedWatch
              tool is built on.

WHY THE STRIP RATHER THAN A HEADLINE PROBABILITY. "72% chance of a cut in
March" is a derived, assumption-laden number: it needs a meeting calendar, an
assumed move size, and a convention for handling the month a meeting falls
mid-way through. The strip itself needs none of that — each contract settles to
the average daily fed funds rate over its month, so `100 − price` IS the
market's expected average policy rate for that month, and the difference
between two of them is the tightening or easing priced between them. That is
the honest primitive, and it is what this panel shows.
