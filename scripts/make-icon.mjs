/**
 * Render the HERMESX mark to a Windows icon: public/hermesx.ico.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. There is no logo file in this repo. The tab favicon in
 * src/app/layout.tsx is an SVG string built inline from HERMES_MARK_D, and the
 * header's Mark draws the same trace straight from CSS tokens. A desktop
 * shortcut needs an .ico on disk, so this rasterises the mark at the default
 * hues (green #00ffb2 -> white sheen -> pink #ff4fa3, see DEFAULT_THEME in
 * src/lib/theme.ts) and packs it. sharp does the rendering — Next already ships
 * it, so no new dependency.
 *
 *   node scripts/make-icon.mjs        # or: npm run icon
 *
 * The .ico is committed; run this only when the mark or its hues change. If the
 * desktop still shows the old picture afterwards that is Explorer's icon cache,
 * not the file — `ie4uinit.exe -show` or a sign-out refreshes it.
 *
 * NOT THE FAVICON'S TREATMENT, ON PURPOSE. The tab icon is a plain black glyph
 * on a transparent tile (owner, 2026-09-01) because a browser tab supplies its
 * own light background. A desktop sits on a wallpaper that supplies nothing, so
 * this carries its own chassis-black tile and the lockup's colours — the same
 * call GEXYGEN's icon makes, which is what lets the two sit side by side and
 * read as a pair.
 *
 * ICO LAYOUT. 16-64 px are stored as classic 32-bit DIBs (readable by every
 * Windows since XP, and what the shell reaches for at desktop sizes); 128 and
 * 256 as PNG entries, which Vista+ decodes and which keep the file small. The
 * mark is drawn fresh at each size rather than scaled from one, so the traced
 * line work stays alive at 16 px and stays fine at 256.

 * with its own fill fattens the ink until it survives the sample grid: 300/size
 * units is about 0.6px of added ink at every size, floored at 8 so the large
 * entries keep the header's weight instead of going spidery.
 *
 * THE CEILING IS WHERE THE FEATHERS CLOSE UP. Fatter is not safer: the wing is
 * five fine strokes with narrow gaps, and past roughly 0.8px of added ink those
 * gaps fill and the wing becomes a green blob with no feathers in it. Measured
 * at 16/24/32 px across strokes 10-30, legibility peaked around 18/13/9 and
