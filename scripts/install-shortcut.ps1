# The default is the APP. Double-clicking it runs dev.ps1 -Tabs: the collector
# and Next.js start as TABS IN ONE Windows Terminal window, GEXYGEN's collector
# joins them in a third if it is on this machine, and the terminal then opens in
# the browser. Every half is skipped if already up, so a second click is safe,
# adds only the tabs that are missing to the same window, and is also how to get
# the browser tab back after closing it.
#
# -Tabs LIVES HERE RATHER THAN IN dev.ps1's DEFAULTS. A double-click has no
# terminal behind it, so three windows arriving unasked is the launcher making a
# mess of the desktop; typing `.\dev.ps1` means you are already sitting in a
# terminal and have your own arrangement, which this has no business rehoming.
# Same script, and the switch is available by hand either way.
#
# -Collector installs the feed-only launcher under its own name, so the two sit
# side by side on the desktop. That one opens the collector ALONE: the live
# source table and the JSON on 8100, no Next.js, no browser.
#
# Re-running replaces the shortcut in place, which is also how to repair it if
# the repo moves. The icon is public\hermesx.ico, made by scripts\make-icon.mjs.
