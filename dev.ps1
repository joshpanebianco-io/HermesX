#   .\dev.ps1 -CollectorOnly  just the feeds — no Next.js, no browser

#
# It ends by opening http://localhost:3100, because starting servers and
# stopping there is not "running the app" — it is running the services. The
# desktop shortcut lands here (scripts\install-shortcut.ps1), and a double-click
# that lights up terminals and shows no terminal looks like it did nothing.
#
# A PLACE EACH, because they are different things to watch. The COLLECTOR is the
# live source feed: one row per source per refresh, with item counts and the age
# of the bytes. The WEB one is just Next.js. Whether those places are separate
# windows or tabs in one window is the only thing -Tabs decides — the desktop
# shortcut passes it, since three windows fanned across the desktop is the cost
# of a double-click, while typing `.\dev.ps1` in a terminal you already have
# open is not the same situation.
#
# IDEMPOTENT ON PURPOSE. Running this twice is the normal case — you come back
# to the project and do not remember which halves survived, and starting a
# second uvicorn on a bound port fails with an oblique WinError 10048. Each
# half is skipped if its port is already listening, which also makes "run the
# app" safe to ask for repeatedly. It is also how you get the browser tab back
# after closing it: click again, nothing restarts, the browser opens.
#
# PORTS ARE 8100/3100, NOT 8000/3000. GEXYGEN owns those, this terminal reads
# GEXYGEN's gamma levels, and the two are expected to be up at the same time.
